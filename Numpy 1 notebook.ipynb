    "\n",
    "**NumPy, which stands for \"Numerical Python,\" is a fundamental Python library for numerical and scientific computing. It provides support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a wide range of mathematical functions to operate on these arrays. NumPy is a free and open-source library, and is available for download from the NumPy website.**\n",
    "\n",
    "**<u>Here are some of the primary use cases for NumPy:</u>**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Multi-dimensional Array Operations:** NumPy's primary data structure is the ndarray (n-dimensional array), which allows us to work with arrays of data efficiently. These arrays can have any number of dimensions and are used for tasks like representing data, images, and more.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Mathematical and Statistical Operations:** NumPy provides a rich set of mathematical and statistical functions, making it suitable for tasks involving linear algebra, calculus, statistics, and more. We can perform operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division on arrays, as well as advanced operations like matrix multiplication, eigenvalue decomposition, and singular value decomposition.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Data Manipulation and Analysis:** NumPy is often used in conjunction with libraries like pandas for data manipulation and analysis. It allows us to load, transform, and manipulate data efficiently, making it a foundational tool for data scientists and analysts.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Machine Learning and Data Science:** NumPy serves as a fundamental building block for many machine learning libraries and frameworks, including scikit-learn and TensorFlow. It's used for creating and manipulating data arrays that are fed into machine learning algorithms.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Plotting and Data Visualization:** While NumPy itself is not designed for data visualization, it is often used in combination with libraries like Matplotlib and Seaborn to create plots, charts, and visualizations from numerical data.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Random Number Generation:** NumPy includes a random number generation module that is useful for tasks like simulations and statistical analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, NumPy is a fundamental tool in the Python ecosystem, and its versatility and efficiency make it indispensable for a wide range of applications, particularly in scientific and numerical computing. NumPy is widely used in data science, machine learning, scientific research, and many other fields where numerical and mathematical operations on large datasets are required."

    "\n",
    "* But heterogeneity actually creates a problem. Now, in the example below, can we say that int \"1\" and the string that we have \n",

    "* Boxes in memory have same size-- for example, each box can store 4 bytes of data. So, if data is equal to or small in size \n",
    "than 4 bytes, we can keep on storing data in contiguous or continuous manner in boxes.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Because python is a dynamic programming language which supports heterogeneity, which means when we create lists, we dont tell python what type of data we are going to store in it, means data can be variable in size and HENCE we dont or cant predict the size of data in python lists.** \n",
    "\n",
    "* Think of RAM as a hugh blob of memory. And now somewhere in RAM, \"1\" will be stored somewhere, \"4.5\" will be stored\n",
    "somewhere completely else, \"string\" will be completely at a different place, same goes with boolean and large int.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **What happens internally is, when we create a python list, python stores the memory addresses of the locations where the list elements are stored.**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Lets suppose we are makng tea and we go to a friend's house and make tea. Now in case 1, all the ingridients to make tea are very well organised and stored in one drawer next to each other. But in case 2, all of these ingridients are present in a list where you have been given the locations of those ingridients, where you will find them. But you have to go that address, fetch that ingridient and use it and repeat the process.\n",
    "\n",
    "* In which of the two cases, will we be able to make tea faster? Obviosly 1st case will be faster.\n",

    "- **Optimized C Code-** Numpy functions are directly implemented in C. Many of the core functions in NumPy are implemented in C, which is a low-level language that can execute code much faster than Python. This means that many NumPy operations are faster than their equivalent pure Python implementations.\n",
